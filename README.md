# Immune-Cell-Composition-estimation-in-the-Pediatric-Brain-Tumor-Atlas



## Background

The Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas is a concerted multi-institution effort by the Childrenâ€™s Brain Tumor Consortium (CBTTC) and the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium to characterize and deeply profile a newly defined cohort of >1,600 brain tumors. Samples are currently profiled with Whole Genome Sequencing, RNA-Sequencing, proteomics, imaging and other platforms with rich phenotypic and longitudinal data.  We attempt to generate tumor-resident immune cell molecular profiles and link these profiles to cancer type and outcome, as it has been shown that the concentration and location of immune cells can predict patient outcome on standard and immunotherapy (Galon, J. et al 2006).  The first goal of this project is to determine immune cell type composition given available public tools  or offer the opportunity to generate  home-grown tools along with reference gene expression profiles for immune cell types of interest to quantify immune cell types in each cancer. Next, we would like to determine if these immune compositions are correlated to any phenotypic data (disease, subtype, etc..) or genetic lesions/pathways. The ideal output of this analysis would be a model that could predict immune cell composition from phenotypic, lesion, and/or pathway data. The  output would also help to further subtype and characterize pediatric brain tumors.
